I am an academic economist broadly interested in Macro-Finance, Asset Pricing and Econometrics. Currently, I am a 5th-year PhD student at Northwestern University. I have written on high-frequency econometrics before, but my current research concentrates on phenomena related to the dynamics of the American yield curve.

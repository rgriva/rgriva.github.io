I am a Finance PhD student at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. I will be joining [FGV EPGE](https://epge.fgv.br/) as an Assistant Professor in August, 2025.

My research interests span Asset Pricing, Machine Learning/Econometrics, and Macro-Finance topics. Currently, my work mainly focuses on understanding how **macroeconomic variables** and **different shocks** impact the dynamics of the **American yield curve**.

I also have a secondary agenda testing implications of models with *subjective beliefs* for the predictability of *market returns*.

In the past, I also worked on high frequency econometric techniques for factor models.

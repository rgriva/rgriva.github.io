I am an Assistant Professor at [FGV EPGE](https://epge.fgv.br/) since July, 2025.

My research interests span Asset Pricing, Macro-Finance, and applied Machine Learning/Econometrics. Currently, my work mainly focuses on understanding how **macroeconomic variables** and **different shocks** impact the dynamics of the **American yield curve**.

I also have a secondary agenda testing implications of models with *subjective beliefs* for the predictability of *market returns*.

In the past, I also worked on high frequency econometric techniques for factor models.

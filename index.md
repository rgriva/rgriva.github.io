I am a Finance PhD student at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. I am available for interviews for the 2024-2025 Job Market season!

My research interests span Asset Pricing, Econometrics, and Macro-Finance topics. Currently, my work mainly focuses on understanding how **macroeconomic variables** and **different shocks** impact the dynamics of the **American yield curve**.

I also have a secondary agenda testing implications of models with *subjective beliefs* for the predictability of *market returns*.

In the past, I worked on high frequency econometric techniques for factor models. Such work has been featured at the Journal of Econometrics.
